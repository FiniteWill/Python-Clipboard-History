# Python-Clipboard-History
Updated: 8/23/22
Python program that replicates and extends the functionality of the Windows 10 built-in Clipboard History tool. 
Originally created because an older computer I was using (which ran Windows 8.1) did not have a built-in clipboard manager.
I decided to create on myself for the purpose of better understanding python and GUI development and here we are.

Planned or implemented functionality includes:

-Storing multiple clipboard contents in GUI entries with copy and delete buttons (implemented)

-Creating a context menu command for manually typing in a new entry (implemented)

-Implement importing from text files for populating entry list (partially implemented)

-Implement saving list of entries to a session file which can be loaded (partially implemented)

-Add drag-and-drop functionality or some other method for reorganizing existing entries (planned)

-Add exporting to multiple file types (planned)

-Add editing for entries in the existing clipboard history (planned)
